# Origins-Reborn

Origins-Reborn is a Paper plugin based on the [Origins (Fabric)](https://modrinth.com/mod/origins) mod by [Apace](https://modrinth.com/user/Apace).

Origins-Reborn is not official, and any bug reports or feature requests for Origins Reborn should be sent to the [Starshooter](https://discord.gg/dQGaXgxMpg) discord server.

If you want more origins, you can see **a list of Origins-Reborn addons** [here](https://starshooter.gitbook.io/origins-reborn/addons)!

## Guide
You can find a detailed guide to Origins-Reborn [here](https://starshooter.gitbook.io/origins-reborn), explaining things like **custom origins**, **custom powers** and more!

Origins-Reborn also has support for Skript, letting you make your own custom powers without needing to make your own plugins!

<H2>The GUI</H2>
<img src="https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/66844da128e2c80f0e446fed36519c2ba2d001d8.png" style="float:right;" width="250">
<P>Though it's only seen for a moment, one of the most recognisable parts of the Origins mod is its origin selection GUI.</P>
  
<P>Here you can see Origins Reborn's close recreation of that GUI, using only the plugin and a resource pack sent to the players upon joining!</P>

<P>Though it's not identical to the original mod, it's a close recreation that'll give your server a professional look.</P>

<P>Using custom fonts to assemble the GUI as it's opened, this GUI functions in a way that lets you create your own custom origins without needing to make any changes to the resource pack!</P>

<H2>The Cooldown Bars</H2>

<P>Not only are they identical to the ones in the mod, appearing just above your hunger, they're also fully customisable!</P>

## Server Hosting (Advertisement)
[![Create a server on Lilypad](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/7fad614e6a2cacfc3c7750086f0190bb0a55841c_0.webp)](https://billing.lilypad.gg/aff.php?aff=66)

## Features
All 10 origins from the original mod are added, as well as the option to select a random origin.

Custom origins are also possible using addon plugins such as [Origins-Mobs](https://modrinth.com/plugin/origins-mobs), [Origins-Monsters](https://modrinth.com/plugin/origins-monsters), [Origins-Fantasy](https://modrinth.com/plugin/origins-fantasy) and [Origins-Magic](https://modrinth.com/plugin/origins-magic).

You can also make your own custom origins using existing abilities by editing the json files in `~/plugins/Origins-Reborn/origins/`.

You can see a full list of abilities on the [GitBook](https://starshooter.gitbook.io/origins-reborn/custom-origins/origin-powers#existing-powers). There is also a guide to making your own abilities using Skript.

<H2>Compatibility</H2>
<P>Origins Reborn is a Paper plugin, meaning it works for server software like Paper and Purpur, though Spigot compatibility may be implemented in the future.</P>

Origins Reborn also has Geyser compatibility using Bedrock's forms feature for the Origin selection menu. There may be some issues with some origin abilities due to inconsistencies between Bedrock and Java, so please report any bugs you find.

## How to use
When joining the server for the first time, players must select an origin. The origins have a custom GUI that looks similar to the GUI from the original mod, with arrows to select origins and scroll up and down in the origin and ability descriptions.

## Configuration
The configuration has options for many things such as randomised origins, enabling a Vault connection for the /origin swap command, choosing a new origin upon death and much more!

There are now also options to prevent players from having the same origins, or to prevent them getting origins they've had before - though when using these it is suggested to use lots of addon origins to avoid running out.

All options in the configuration are labelled and explained to make modifying the configuration easier.
